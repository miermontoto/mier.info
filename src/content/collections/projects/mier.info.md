## intro
this webpage is a collection of my personal projects, a place that i control that allows me to build and publish my own small ideas.
i've spent a lot of time building it and slowly redefining it (yet it still looks like this)
even though it's not impressive neither visually nor technically, it represents my ideas and beliefs.

## tech
almost everything you see, from the breadcrumbs to the buttons, is handcrafted and built from scratch with <img src="/assets/icons/tech/eleventy.svg" class="icon" alt="eleventy">, hosted in <img src="/assets/icons/tech/firebase.svg" class="icon" alt="firebase">, using <img src="/assets/icons/tech/nunjucks.svg" class="icon" alt="nunjucks">, <img src="/assets/icons/tech/sass.svg" class="icon" alt="sass">, <img src="/assets/icons/tech/markdown.svg" class="icon" alt="markdown"> (and a ton of client-side <img src="/assets/icons/tech/js.svg" class="icon" alt="javascript">).

apart from having its github repo, it is connected to firebase hosting through CI/CD using github actions, including the 'beta' branch that hosts the latest changes before going live.

## design
the "design" is a tribute to the legendary [daft punk 90's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20220223020719/https://daftpunk.com/).
as you can probably tell, it's a very important reference for me, and even though it doesn't hold up to today's standards, i've always loved the simplicty and the way that it looks.

from the 1st of december to the 7th of january every year, there is snow falling falling (thanks to [zachleat](https://github.com/zachleat/snow-fall))
